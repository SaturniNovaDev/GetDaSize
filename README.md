# GetDaSize
A small python desktop app I made to view folder trees, view file contents and measure file and folder sizes.

GetDaSize originally started as a small freetime project of mine because I had to work with large amounts of data as part of my other 
projects, so I thought "What if I started building my own efficient file explorer?", and that's how this project was born.

Currently, GetDaSize only has very small and humble features (it's still very raw, come on), however I aim to further develop this 
project and, someday, achieve to create a fast, memory efficient and reliable file explorer for all platforms (hopefully not built on 
python, though).

If you want to use GetDaSize you just have to download the current python file, run `pip install pyinstaller`, then place the python 
file in a specific dir and run `pyinstaller --onefile --windowed GetDaSize.pyw` while in the same directory.

Or simply just run the python file.

Okay have fun!

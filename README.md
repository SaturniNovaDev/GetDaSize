# GetDaSize
A small python desktop app I made to view folder trees, view file contents and measure file and folder sizes.

GetDaSize originally started as a small freetime project of mine because I had to work with large amounts of data as part of my other 
projects, so I thought "What if I started building my own efficient file explorer?", and that's how this project was born.

Currently, GetDaSize only has very small and humble features (it's still very raw, come on), however I aim to further develop this 
project and, someday, achieve to create a fast, memory efficient and reliable file explorer for all platforms (hopefully not built on 
python, though).
